# Indeed web scraper project in Python
This project was done to improve my knowledge for python and learn web scraping by using Beautiful Soup. Furthermore, i used a medium.com tutorial on how to create a web scraping script. 

## Purpose 
A Python web scraping script that extracts the first 3 pages of a job search in Python

User is asked if they wish to work in CA or US, type of job, location, and salary. these inputs are then used to generate the URL that will be accessed by BeautifulSoup
